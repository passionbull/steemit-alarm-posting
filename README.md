## WHAT IS THE PROJECT ABOUT?
I want to introduce my project "Personal Steemit Notification Bot".
There are many notification bots, but this project helps each user develop steemit notification bot by yourself.
This project is python-based notification bot that anyone can modify.
It`s main function is to receive notifications of tags and author's messages that you want on your own computer like below image.

## SOME CONTRIBUTIONS.
It has scalability. Users can put everything they want.
This project is implemented to use the information needed for the yaml file without using a DB like mysql.
Personally, when I received a notification, I make the BB-8 shine.
I included this module to my git repository.
